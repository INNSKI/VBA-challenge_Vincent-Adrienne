## Evaluation of stock data 2018 to 2020

###### Summary
Stock volumes were evaluated for years 2018, 2019, 2020. From 2018 to 2020 the total average stock price increased by +0.07%.

This was because there were small average gains in 2018 (+0.16%), but the average stock volume fell in 2019 (-0.22%) and then recovered slightly in 2020 (+0.13%).

Although the vast majority of stocks were within one standard deviation of the mean across all years, there were also several outliers. 
Some stocks increased by as much as 190% whereas others decreased in volume by as much as 92% in the three year period.

Evaluating the top 10 companies that made the most gains in 2018, 2019 & 2020, there was no consistency between years.

###### Conclusion
Over the period 2018-2020 the stock market grew less than 1%. There was no consistent well-performing company in the top 10 for gains & therefore no recommendation based on the data set as far as a company to invest in can be made.

###### Methods
The data were evaluated using a VBA Macro. A year was from 2 Jan to 31 Dec. The opening volume of the stock on 2 Jan was subtracted from the closing value of the stock on 31 Dec for each company. The percent change was then calculated.

###### Limitations
In order to make a recommendation on which company to invest in, it would be prudent to evaluate the stock market changes over a longer period of time.
